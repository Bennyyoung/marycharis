<h2>THE AFRICAN CHILD PROJECT (T.A.C.P) 2022</h2>
<h3>ABOUT:</h3>
  <p>
    The T.A.C.P programme, is being convened and promoted by the Marycharis Benevolence Foundation (M.B.F), a registered non-profit and charitable organization.
  </p>

  <p>
    As an organization with a Vision and Focus on the African child, the T.A.C.P programme is launched to provide succour for children, while reducing and possibly eradicating the lack and varying degrees of problem faced by the African Child.
  </p>

  <h3>OUR FOCUS</h3>
  <p>
    Our primary focus this year on the T.A.C.P project is to equip, aide, educate and feed the African child, with our target participants in the many rural communities across the Lagos West Senatorial District (particularly Badagry and its environs).
  </p>

  <h3>OUR GOAL</h3>
  <p>
    Our goal is to provide the African child with basic/vocational education/trainings periodically.
  </p>

  <p>
    On account of the importance of education in the development of children in the society, it is our firm conviction and belief that these trainings would bring and/or enhance the dignity of the African child. We have no scintilla of doubt whatsoever that these trainings/education would not only liberate the African child from all forms of mental slavery and depravation but also improve their character and social awareness, including the discovery of their innate talents/gifts/skill-set.
  </p>

  <p>
    Next, to provide the African child with all essential material resources needed for their education, provision of food for the African Child from our Marycharis Foundation food banks and food donations from our supporters, sponsors, and partners.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, as part of our activities, we shall be embarking on an aggressive drive towards educating the African child on the causes, effects, and prevention of diseases and infections ravaging the African populace. We shall also be leading and promoting conversations/engagements and campaigns on how to prevent and abstain from them, in order to help in the reduction of mortality and the spread of many terminal diseases affecting the development and well-being of the African child.
  </p>

  <h3>T.A.C.P 2022- PROGRAMME ACTIVITIES</h3>
  <p>
    Our T.A.C.P 2022 programme of activities shall be held in the Imeke community, Badagry, where it would play host to other communities within its environs. We are therefore, focused on the following:
  </p>
  <p>üëâüèª provision of safe water for children in the local community schools.</p>
  <p>üëâüèª Sensitization of children on the rules of personal hygiene and sanitary measures.</p>
  <p>üëâüèª Vocational training programs on Fine/Creative arts in areas of painting, sculpture, imaginative drawings, and handcrafting.</p>
  <p>üëâüèª Provision of school bags, cardigans, and socks (our children's back to school project).</p>
  <p>üëâüèª Teachers/Caregivers incentives.</p>

  <h3>OUR PROJECT RESULT</h3>
  <p>
    Our project results are essentially targeted at a package, aimed at positively affecting the children in multiple ways that would enhance and provide them with opportunities leverage to become successful in life.
  </p>

  <h3>OUR APPEAL</h3>
  <p>
