        <h4>MBF GOAL</h4>
        <div style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>
          <p className="flow-text">

            The goal of <b>MBF</b> is to ultimately develop each zone into a self-sufficient mission with well-equipped health care facilities, staffed and operated by local medical personnel and volunteers, a daily working food bank (prepared and raw), functional grade to secondary schools at undeserved locations for the fatherless, less-privileged, less-fortunate and the vulnerable, skill acquisition training centre and among others.
            This takes time, manpower, dedication and funding.

            God is the source of missions and human means are needed in mission – <b>NO MAN CAN BE TRULY RICH WHO IS SELFISH</b>

        <h4>HISTORY</h4>
        <div style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>
          <p className="flow-text">
            MARYCHARIS BENEVOLENCE FOUNDATION (MBF) was founded by Mary Emmanuel on Thursday 28th December, 1995, as a prayer group with a woman and two unmarried ladies – Mrs. Felicia Adiri, Betty Ogbeide and Edith Franklin. On the said day, Rev’d (Dr) Kehinde Olabintan was invited to minister and dedicate the mission and to pray on Mary Emmanuel.
          </p>

          <p className="flow-text">
            It was first named
            <b>
              “BENEVOLENT MINISTRIES INTERDENOMINATIONAL” (BMI)
            </b>
            and later renamed to <b>“BENEVOLENT MISSIONS’ INTERNATIONAL” (BMI)</b> on Saturday 2nd December, 2000 at the missions’ Annual celebration/appeal fund for Gospel outreach, where pastor Dele Ayeni, suggested that the mission be opened to all gender.
          </p>

          <p className="flow-text">
            After a close look into it, with cross examinations from Biblical perspective, the suggestion was adopted and there after <b>BMI</b> was opened to all.
            Benevolent Missions’ International <b>(BMI)</b>, sprouted from a godly spirited, motivated, emotional, empathetic mind of the convener, Mary Emmanuel, from her growing-up years after the death of her father, as she watched her mother suffered, tortured, as a widow and other widows, as is common in Nigeria especially and in Africa in general.
          </p>

          <p className="flow-text">
            This ignited her inborn vision to love, care, help, serve and through hard-work to fulfill this mandate.
            Also Mary Emmanuel’s survival after a ghastly motor accident she was involved in on her way to Jos in Plateau state, Nigeria gave her second chance to love and do her creator’s work –serving humanity.
          </p>

          <p className="flow-text">

            Several attempts were made to register <b>BMI</b> with the Government, but on Friday 24th September 2021, the Federal Government of Nigeria, <b>CORPORATE AFFAIRS COMMISSION</b> approved <b>MARYCHARIS BENEVOLENCE FOUNDATION (MBF)</b> as a rebranded name of <b>BMI</b>, and on Tuesday 2nd November 2021, the <b>CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION</b> was issued by the <b>C.A.C</b> of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.
